# Theory

In this entry, I'll explore some basic concepts of theory. 

- What is the halting problem? Why is it undecidable? What are other undecidable problems?

The Halthing problem is when a program on certain input will accept it and halt or reject it and halt and it would never go into an infinite loop. Basically halting means terminating. So can we have an algorithm that will tell that the given program will halt or not. In terms of Turing machine, will it terminate when run on some machine with some particular given input string. This is an undecidable problem because we cannot have an algorithm which will tell us whether a given program will halt or not in a generalized way.

Another undecidable problem includes Fermat's Theorem.

- What is combinatory logic? Is combinatory logic Turing complete?

Combinatory logic is a model by which logical statements can be described as a combination of a small number of primitive elements called combinators. Each combinator is like a function or lambda abstraction, but without any free variables. It's Turing complete because Combinatory logic can capture the meaning of any arithmetic or logical statement.
